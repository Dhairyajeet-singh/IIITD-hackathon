          Our Team ctrl_alt_del have been working on the project Healthy-HER which revolves around women and teens
          health and helping them contact doctors, gynecologists, psychocologists,
          providing healthcare services in remote areas. Visiting a gynecologist,
          a psychocologist is still a taboo subject even in this modern world. Hence we provide a platform where women can
          connect users with expert professionals.
